I made this to inspire my friends to get into coding, so please add more and more features to this simple chatting form

When I started, my main struggle was not knowing where to start, I could finish any project but I would break down if you give me a blank page

So here is a very simple chatting app

Create a new form project and paste this code in the main Form, adjust the functions to your controls

When you choose a chatting service, adjust the api structure according to the docs
